            <section class="what-we-do">What we do... 
            <p>We do comp sci stuff, like coding, debugging, and pretending we know what we're doing. It's basically magic, but with more caffine and fewer wands.</p>
            <p>Sometimes we even build things that work! Other times, we just stare at error messages until they go away (spoiler: they don't).</p>
            <p>But hey, at least we have fun while we're doing it! And if all else fails, we can always blame the computer.</p>
            <p>So if you're looking for a place to learn, grow, and maybe even break a few things along the way, you've come to the right place.</p>
            <p>Join us for programming competitions, games, and free food.</p>
            <p>Whether you're a coding wizard or just starting out, there's something for everyone!</p>
